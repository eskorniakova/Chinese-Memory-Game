# Chinese-Memory-Game

## Hello

#This is a quizlet-like app for reviewing Chinese words. 

#This particular app has words related to computer science, but the code can be changed to include other characters or even words from other languages (one would just need to change the language on their keyboard to make edits in a different language). 

#This is my first attempt at working with GUI and the Tkinter library. Please let me know if there are better ways to code this, and feel free to use this as a basis for a much better, complicated game. 

#Happy Coding!
